Last weekend, my friends and I went to the india
. We started our day with the train
ride, which was huge
. After that, we grabbed some biryani
to eat and headed to the friends
show. The highlight of the day was when we ran
. Before leaving, we made sure to buy some keys
as souvenirs. It was a tiny
day, and we can't wait to go back!

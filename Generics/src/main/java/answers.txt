What are Generic Types?
Generic Types allow you to create classes, interfaces, and methods that operate on types specified by the user at runtime. This means that instead of a class being designed for a specific data type (like int or String), it can work with any type that is provided.

Why are Generic Types useful?
Generic Types provide type safety by allowing only a specified type to be used, reducing runtime errors. They also improve code reusability because you can use the same class for multiple data types without rewriting it for each one.

What Java API class(es) have you already used in this class that use Generic Types?
Classes such as ArrayList, HashMap, and HashSet in Java's Collections framework use Generics. For example, ArrayList<Integer> ensures that only Integer objects can be stored in the list.

What is one specific situation where using Generic Types provides an advantage over a specific type?
Generics are beneficial when creating collections or containers that should store multiple object types while maintaining type safety. For instance, a Box<T> class can hold various item types, such as Book or Toy, without creating separate BoxForBook and BoxForToy classes.
